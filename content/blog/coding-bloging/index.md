Welcome to this very simple blog, you are reading my first post. Inspired by the work of many great
programmers, and after many failed attempts to start a personnal blog, here I am … AGAIN.
I believe that persistance is one of the most important skills to have, especially as a developper.
Frustration moments are endless, you have to continiously hit that wall stopping you till it breaks.

Why
I never had a personnal blog, always wanted it but never had time (motivation). Not sure if it’s due to
the fear of commitement, or the fear of sharing poor content with awful writing style or having to post regulary, maybe it’s a mix of everything I mentionned !
As a challenge, I decided to start this blog to push myself out from the comfort zone and also improve my learning/writing in the way.

How
Choosing a blogging engine wasn’t really that complicated. It’s just a tool and the focus should be toward the content not the style.
